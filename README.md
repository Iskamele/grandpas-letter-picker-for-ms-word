This application was created so that my grandfather could select the character he needed and add it to MS Word as an initial, preserving the style: font, and size.

### How it works:
- Run the LetterPickerApp class;
- Select the desired font size;
- Click on any required letter;
- Paste it into MS Word.

You can compile this application to .jar and create .exe using the tool https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/.
